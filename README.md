# Bus 3D Simulator Graphics

## Project for Computer Graphics subject on Faculty of Technical Sciences

## Student: Veselin Roganovic SV 36/2022

## Short description
TBD

## How to run

I used CLion on my MacBook to run all this. 
First you need to install GLEW, GLFW3, GLM and FreeType using brew (brew install glew glfw3 glm freetype).
Then you need to build and run project (it will load executable files and dependencies in CMakeLists.txt).

It is probably possible to run it on Windows too, but you will need to install GLEW, GLFW3, GLM and FreeType,
and change paths to them in CMakeLists.txt.
